# Vecspark

**VecSpark** is a scalable framework designed to process large-scale word embeddings efficiently using Apache Spark. It enables seamless vector operations for natural language processing (NLP) tasks while optimizing storage and computation in distributed environments.

## Key Features
- **Scalability**: Leverages Apache Spark for distributed processing of massive word embeddings.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces computational overhead with optimized vector operations.
- **Flexibility**: Supports a wide range of NLP applications, from similarity computations to clustering.
- **Integration**: Easily integrates with existing Spark-based pipelines for big data analytics.

## Applications
- Word similarity and semantic analysis.
- Clustering and classification of textual data.
- Dimensionality reduction and visualization of embeddings.

VecSpark is ideal for handling high-dimensional data in a distributed setting, making it a powerful tool for researchers and developers working on large-scale NLP projects.
